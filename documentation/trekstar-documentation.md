# System Description

The Trekstar system has been developed in order to allow TrekStar Pictures to accomplish the following

- Create and Manage Projects including any relevant metadata
- Create and Manage Project Materials (single-sided DVDs, Blu-rays, etc)
- Create Projects that are "unreleased" and cannot be modified once created
- Include details in regards to the crew working on a Project

## Cohesion and Coupling Considerations

### Cohesion

The concept of cohesion is defined as 'the degree to which all elements of a component are directed towards a single task, within a single component, or to which the responsibilities of a class are related'.

Within the design, it was important to separate out the logic for the presentation of the information from the business logic. We have achieved this using a Model - View - Controller architecture. In order for the views to gather data from the Models themselves, a large number of *so-called* getter functions are present. This is so that the models are not responsible for the presentation and **logical cohesion** does not occur. Utilising these functions also provides an example of how communicational cohesion has been considered within the design, whilst the separation of these elements has provided the situation of functional cohesion.

Another example of how **logical cohesion** has been avoided is the approach taken to importing data from files. This logic is contained within its own object and the only data which is passed into their respective objects is a *serialised* version - separating the concerns surrounding the importing of files.

Further details on cohesion, relating to specific design patterns, can be found in that section of the document. 

### Coupling

Due to the relationships between different objects within the system, some coupling does occur. An example of this is that a Project has Materials associated with it - thus creating a dependency between the two objects. However, the relationships defined within the class diagram show that the two related objects don't modify the data of eachother, but store data about eachother independently. The data between these two objects could therefore be considered to be uncoupled.

# Deployment Diagrams

There are two possible deployment scenarios for the TrekStar management system, these being:

1. An individual user will have the TrekStar project management system installed on their machine, using a locally stored JSON Database.
2. TrekStar Pictures will release the TrekStar project management system company-wide, using a shared JSON Database for each installation.

These two deployments are different due to the change in the data storage location, in which the latter will support company-wide collaboration through the application. 

However, no matter where the application is installed the following Operating Systems are supported:

- Windows
- Mac OS
- Linux

On the following pages you can find a visual representation of the aforementioned Deployment scenarios.

# Design Pattern

## Factory Design Pattern

Include explanation of any design patterns used

With a large number of *materials* defined within the business rules, it was appropriate to use a **factory design pattern** to generate different material types based upon an input provided by the user. The specific implementation involved defining a return type as the base material class - allowing a covariant return type. This design pattern was possible as we have a common interface for every material. A UML representation of this pattern can be found below.

![MaterialFactory UML Class Diagram](images/class-diagrams/material-factory.jpg)

The advantages of this pattern is that new materials types can easily be added by adding a small conditional statement in this class. This provides a level of abstraction and means that this class has only a single responsibility - to construct materials - removing this logic from the consuming object. This helps with the issue of coupling as functional cohesion is achieved. Because of the abstraction, it wouldn't mean any changes would necessarily have to occur in the consuming class.

## Singleton

Through the logging library spdlog, a singleton pattern was used in order to ensure a single logging instance is present within the application. This involved creating this instance as soon as the application was launched, and then accessed (using the library) within the areas of the application logging is used e.g. in the application. 

A common issue with this pattern is the issue of multithreading, particularly with respect to file handling. There could be multiple components within the application that could be trying to access the log, which is why it's important to have a single instance.

# Planned Architecture

## Architecture Presentation

Architecture tradeoff analysis method (ATAM) was used to decide on an architecture which was to be followed for the development of the Trekstar Project Management System.

### Model-View-Controller
MVC is driven by interaction. The use of views to prompt their respective controllers to modify the model and subsequently update the view in real time fits the requirements of the Trekstar system. Models act as the data store for all of the related objects within the system. Controllers manipulate the data in the models through an exposed interface on the model objects

## Microservices

The idea of a microservice architecture is to have a collection of small, modular components which are brought together to make an application (Wayner, 2019). This approach allows components of the system to be independent of eachother - creating an application which is significantly decoupled from its components. This will result in a better standard of cohesion and a more manintaninable application in the long-run, potentially facilitating easier further development.

 In order for these components of the system to integrate together, to make an application, communication has to be established between them. This adds another layer of complexity to the system which might not be present with other software architectures. Given the time constraints with the project, it might be a challenge to meet all the requirements and meet the respective time constraints.

## Utility Tree

 The management of projects requires fast, realtime interaction (Unknown, 2017). The requirements gathered from Trekstar meant that some of the data needs to be presented in a different manner (e.g. displaying the contents of a double sided DVD). Due the benefit of MVC being able to present data in multiple formats, this made it an ideal choice. One of the stretch goals of the project was to provide the user with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). By using MVC, it will be easier to produce views for a GUI rather than a console based interface as only one component of the system (the views) will need to be changed out.

As previously mentioned in other sections, separating the logic for presenting and performing the business model provides benefits with regards to de-coupling and setting clear boundaries within the system. Given that the components of the MVC architecture are independent of eachother, they can be developed in isolation. Within the context of the project, where individual members are responsible for different sections of the project - e.g. one for data structures & one for the user interface - the development of these components could happen in tandem. This will allow the project to develop at a faster rate and have less dependencies with respect to interrelated tasks.

# Included C++ Libraries

Within the TrekStar project management application we have used some C++ Libraries for parsing data, providing access to unit tests and including core functionality that would otherwise not be present. Below you can find an explanation of the included C++ libraries and why we chose to use them:

## JSON for C++ ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/nlohmann/json))
It was decided to use the JSON for C++ library within the application because we are using JSON as our database to store all of the users data. The JSON for C++ library allows us to parse JSON data, request data based on certain keys within a JSON Array or Object and create new JSON Arrays or Objects to be inserted into the database. The JSON for C++ library is quite easily the most feature complete and well documented library for parsing and creating JSON in C++, this was the main driving force behind using this library as we required something that is reliable and suitable for the applications use cases.

## GTest ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/google/googletest))
It was decided to use GTest as our primary unit testing library within the application, whilst we could have used Boost for unit testing, we decided that GTest had the following advantages which solidified our decision to use GTest:

- GTest is much more lightweight when compared to Boost, while GTest is specifically a testing library, Boost has more functionality that also needs to be imported to allow for the Unit Testing section of the library to function, consequently making it larger and less lightweight.
- When compared to other Unit Testing libraries there are more features that we can make use of in the project within GTest, for example, we can use GTests ability to mock objects, this is useful when we need to test the interaction between objects as we can achieve this more efficiently when compared to other libraries. We can also avoid duplication of test setup (creating objects, etc) within each unit test by specifying test fixtures which can be referenced within the unit tests.

## spdlog ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog))
It was decided to use spdlog for our logger library, when compared to other libraries spdlog is lightweight, fast and only requires header imports to get started. spdlog also supports all of the operating systems that our application has been developed to work on, which is an important feature to have.

spdlog also allows us to easily generate the required daily reports based on the data we pass from the JSON database, the simplicity of this library was an important consideration as it allows future developers to quickly understand how this function works incase a new feature or bug needs to be added/fixed.

\newpage

# Internal Data Structures

During the design phase of the TrekStar project management application it was decided that an internal data structure of Stack would be used. While there are pros and cons to each data structure, ultimately it was decided that the Stack data structure fit the best with the requirements of our application, you can find the in-depth reasoning behind the decision to use Stack below:

- The Stack data structure allows for the sequential ordering of disks, and make sense within our use cases. For example, if you have a box set of 4 disks and you would like to add a new disk, its likely that the new disk will be the latest episode, therefore it will be inserted sequentially at the end of the list. Another example would be when a user would like to remove a disk from a boxset, it is unlikely that you will want to remove the 3rd episode within the boxset, however if the 3rd episode was to be removed then the 4th episode (the last one in the underlying vector) can be removed allowing for the 3rd episode to then be removed, therefore the Stack data structure is still appropriate.
- Another advantage to the Stack data structure is that data can be accessed quicker sequentially, this is because you can iterate though the underlying vectors data finding items that a requested.
- A final advantage to the Stack data structure is that it uses general programming through the use of templating, as a consequence of this, the Stack data structure supports multiple data types. This allows the stack to be used in different contexts, if required.

# Search/Sorting Algorithm

## Merge Sort

### Explaination

The merge sort algorithm was used to sort a list of projects based on their title.

Merge sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm where the list recursively partitioned in to halves, until each sublist is of length one, and therefore sorted by definition as the single project is the smallest and the largest in that sublist. The sublists are then sorted and merged into larger sublists until they are recombined into a single sorted list.

The list of projects is split into two halves. Each half then goes through a similar process whereby the halves are repeatedly split until they are of length one, which is, by definition, a sorted list.

The sublists in each half are then merged together by following this process until all projects are in the merged list:
- compare the first project in the left half with the first project in the right half;
- if the project in the left half is less than the project in the right half, add the project from the left half to the merged list and read the next project from the left half;
- if the project in the right half is less than the project in the left half, add the project from the right half to the merged list and read the next project from the right half; and
- once either list is empty, any remaining projects are added to the merged list.

The two halves are then merged together by following the same process above until all projects are in the merged list. As merge sort is an "in-place" sorting algorithm and the list of project was passed by reference, there is no return value. The list of projects is now sorted and can be used as such from where the merge sort function was originally called.

### Justification

The implementation of a merge sort algorithm was determined to be necessary in order to benefit from the higher efficiency of sorting using the binary search algorithm, as described below. The merge sort algorithm was used as when compared to other alternatives, such as quick sort, merge sort is more efficient on larger datasets. While the testing was completed with small numbers of projects, it is likely that, if this software was to be used in the real world, there may be hundreds of thousands of projects sorted in the projects list.

Further discussion of the time complexity of merge sort can be found in [Computational Efficiency](#computational-efficiency).

## Binary Search

### Explaination

Binary search algorithm was used to find a project based on its title. The merge sort algorithm described above is performed before, as the binary search has a prerequisite that the list of projects be sorted.

An overload equals operator was created on the *Project* class; this was used to check if the search criteria of a project title was equal to the title attribute in the project when checking if the item at *mid* was the desired project.

The binary search algorithm requires the following variables:
* an integer variable *result* set to -1;
* an integer variable *low* set to 0;
* an integer variable *high* set to the index of the last project in the list; and
* an integer variable *mid*.

While the integer variable *result* is equal to -1 no project has been found that matches the search criteria, and the following steps should be taken repeatedly until a project is found or it has been determined that the project does not exist in the list:
* calculate a midpoint by using the equation *mid = low + ((high - low) / 2)*;
* if the project at the midpoint is equal to the search criteria, *result* can be set to this project;
* if the project at the midpoint is less than the search criteria, set the *low* to *mid + 1*; and
* if the project at the midpoint is greater than the search criteria, set the *high* to *mid â€“ 1*.

After these stages have been completed, the value of *result* can be returned. The subsequent code can then display that the project was not found if *-1* is returned. Otherwise, the *result* can be used as an index value to access the project in the list and display its detail to the user.

### Justification

A movie company, such as TrekStar, may have a large number of projects. It is important that searching these projects is efficient; the binary search algorithm avoids checking every project in the list. This is because comparisons are made to determine which half of the list the target project resides within. As a result, on each iteration, half of the project list is discarded.

Further discussion of the time complexity of binary search can be found in [Computational Efficiency](#computational-efficiency).

# Software Testing Procedure
Software Testing is an important part of the SDLC and within our project we have multiple constraints in place to ensure that tested, bug-free code is committed to the GitHub repository. Committing working code to the repository is important for a number of reasons, with some of these being:

- Developers will never pull broken code that will lead to a slow down in development.
- Developers will never have to fix someone elses broken code, avoiding time wasted on parts of the application that is not allocated to that developers.
- In case of a rollback, the repository will always be in a good state, which helps to avoid further rollbacks.

Some of the constraints that we have in place are:

- Developers will only commit code that has the associated unit tests created and those unit tests must pass.
- Developers must never commit broken code that could impede the efficiency of other developers, if a commit is required a new branch should be created.
- If there are known bugs, developers must log these within the GitHub Issues to ensure that other developers know that it is know/being worked on incase they come across it.

Our group is confident that these constraints will allow us to develop the application with fewer interruptions and ensure that only high quality, tested code is being pushed to the repository.

# Conclusion

## Testing Approach
The unit tests written using Google Test allowed us to perform continuous testing as we added new functionality to the application. Should any new code cause the tests to fail, we were able to immediately backtrack and fix the bug. This prevented bugs "snowballing" in to larger issues that could have caused unnecessary delays and stress later in development.


## Computational Efficiency

When deciding which algorithm to use to search for a project based on its title, it was decided that a linear search would be far too inefficient. Linear search has an average time complexity of *O(n)*; while this would be suitable for smaller datasets, its inefficiency would become more apparent as more projects are added. As a result, it was decided that a binary search should be used, accompanied by a merge sort in order to satisfy the pre-requisites of the binary search.

The binary search has an average time complexity of *O(log n)* and the merge sort has an average time complexity of *O(n log n)*. As a result, despite performing two operations, the overall average time complexity remains logarithmic and therefore scales well when the dataset containing projects grows.


## Reliability

The reliability of the application was deemed to be good due to the extensive set of unit tests and comprehensive test plan. It was understood that user's actions can not always be predicted and therefore, large amounts of destructive testing proved that the application would not fail due to user input.


## Security

When working on the project there were multiple considerations around the security of the application, you can see some of the considerations below, however, due to time restrictions it was not feasible to implement the features:

- As a major feature implementation it was a consideration to add User Roles to the application, this would allow an organisation to control who has access to what information or functionality, for example, an organisation could create the reader and writer roles. The writer role would allow assigned users to add projects, project materials, crew, etc and read data. Whereas the reader role would only allow users to view what data has been inputted into the system. We see this addition as an important inclusion into the application as it will help to protect the security/integrity of the data.
- As a more minor implementation, it was a consideration to add integrity validation to the JSON file to ensure that the database has not been tampered with, this would be achieved by creating a SHA256 hash of the JSON content when the application is gracefully closed and then verifying the hash is the same upon opening the application. This would allow the application to verify that the content has not been tampered with while it was closed, protecting the security and integrity of the application data.


## Portability

The application makes use of mostly standard library components that are part of C++. Any additional libraries used for the main application are header-only libraries that can be included alongside the source code and, again, make use of standard library components. This means that building the application will be successful on any platform capable of running a C++ compiler build for the C++11 standard.

It must be noted that Google Test must be installed should user wish to compile and run the tests. However, it was deemed that this would only be performed by further maintainers of the software and therefore its portability was not as crucial.


## Maintainability

The modular design of the application allows new methods to be added to the models, view and controllers without changing the behaviour of existing components. This means that future maintainers of the application would be able to extend its functionality easily.

The code is well documented and commented and the provided diagrams of the system are a good reflection of its design and implementation. This would allow further maintainers to quickly understand the architecture of the code and be able to make changes easily.


## Scalability

When developing the application scalability was considered and the design of the applications database will allow for organisations to release the application via a Group Policy Object (on Windows machines) and report back to the central database that will provide the information to the applications. This means that it is possible to scale the application across all employees.

# Appendix

## Managing group work

 Whilst working on this project our group used a multitude of methods to ensure that we were collaborating efficiently and getting the most amount of work completed as possible, these methods included, but are not limited to:

 - Using Facebook Messenger to converse with other group members about certain aspects of the program or documentation, this allowed us to keep in touch and ensure we were on track with the workload.
 - Using GitHub to its full potential, this includes the use of GitHub Issues and Pull Requests in conjunction with code reviews for each major feature. Whenever a bug or issue was discovered the group member that uncovered the issue would create a GitHub issue. If the bug was within another group members individual work then that member would be added as a participant so that they could fix the issue. Once large features were added to the program, pull requests were used with each group member being requested to review the code before merging into the master branch.

Overall, our experience of working as a group has been productive and enjoyable, being able to distribute the workload across group members was an important aspect to the project and allowed us to complete it efficiently. We have all taken learning points from this experience that could be applied to the workplace, or even in our upcoming placements. For example:

- The use of GitHub's features (such as pull requests, issues and code reviewing) will be an excellent skill to have within the workplace, as more often than not, organisations will have some sort of code review system/Quality Assurance (QA) procedure in place and being able to understand how this all works without training will show that you are a competent employee.
- The use of a messaging platform was also important, sometimes organisations have employees working across the globe and having the ability to efficiently collaborate on messaging systems (such as Slack) is an important skill to have. 


## Meeting Minutes

During group meetings a member was nominated to write minutes, these minutes were an important factor during the development of the application as they allowed us to go back and check what work we have all be allocated. On the following pages you can find the minutes for the aforementioned meetings.
